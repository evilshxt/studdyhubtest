# StuddyHub – Security & Frontend Review

Reviewer: Elite Wednesday (@evilshxt), Malvado (@supernovaprime), Edwey (@edwey)  
Date: 2026-02-10  
Scope: Observation of publicly accessible client functionality and Supabase interactions using standard browser capabilities. No intrusion techniques or bypass attempts were performed.

---

## Executive Summary

During testing, unauthenticated or low-privilege client interactions with Supabase backend appeared to return records from several user-associated tables. Because Supabase browser clients rely on Row Level Security (RLS) for protection, these observations may indicate missing or overly permissive policies.

Further confirmation by the engineering team is recommended.

---

## Methodology

Testing was performed by:

- Inspecting network traffic generated by the production frontend.
- Replaying requests using the same public project URL and anon key shipped to the client.
- Making no attempt to escalate privileges or access hidden systems.

---

## Findings

### 1. Anonymous / Public Client Data Access

Requests made with public anon credentials returned rows from multiple tables.

Observed examples include:

- `profiles` 
- `notes` 
- `documents` 
- `chat_sessions` 
- `class_recordings` 
- `schedule_items` 

### Why this matters
If these responses are accessible without ownership validation, users may be able to read data belonging to others.

### Confidence Level
Medium – requires confirmation of expected behavior and policy design.

---

### 2. Storage Bucket Accessibility

Listing or fetching from certain buckets appeared possible using public credentials.

In some applications this is intentional (e.g., avatars, shared media).  
If any bucket is meant to be private, additional restrictions may be required.

### Storage Test Results
| Storage Bucket | Access Level | Files Found | Risk Level |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Public Bucket | ALLOWED | 0 files | HIGH |
| Generated Images | ALLOWED | 0 images | HIGH |
| Documents | ALLOWED | 10 documents | HIGH |
| Public Image URLs | ALLOWED | Direct access successful | HIGH |

### Confidence Level
Needs product clarification.

---

### 3. What Was NOT Observed

- No service-role or admin Supabase keys in the client bundle.
- No database passwords or JWT signing secrets.
- No evidence of privilege escalation mechanisms.

- **Layout Breaks**: Responsive design not properly implemented for all screen sizes
- **Touch Targets**: Some interactive elements may be too small for touch interaction

### 🔧 **Technical Debt**
- **Module Resolution**: Dynamic imports failing due to incorrect MIME types
- **Bundle Splitting**: Code splitting not working properly for certain pages
- **Error Handling**: Missing proper error boundaries and fallbacks

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Severity | Impact |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Data Privacy | CRITICAL | Complete user data exposure |
| Compliance | HIGH | GDPR/privacy regulation violations |
| Security | HIGH | Unauthorized system access |
| Business | MEDIUM | Competitive intelligence exposure |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Implement RLS Policies** on all user data tables
2. **Restrict Storage Access** with proper authentication
3. **Audit API Keys** and limit anonymous access
4. **Add Data Ownership** verification
5. **Implement Session Validation** for all data operations

### Long-term Security Improvements
1. **Regular Security Audits** and penetration testing
2. **Data Encryption** for sensitive information
3. **Access Logging** and monitoring
4. **Security Training** for development team

## Testing Methodology

This audit was conducted using a comprehensive security testing suite that:
- Tests all production database tables
- Evaluates RLS policy effectiveness
- Checks storage bucket permissions
- Validates authentication mechanisms
- Exports findings for analysis
